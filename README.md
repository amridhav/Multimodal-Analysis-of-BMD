# Multimodal-Analysis-of-BMD
- Objective: To undertake a comparative examination of diverse imaging methodologies and algorithmic approaches, with the aim of ascertaining the optimal strategy to achieve precise classification of Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
  
- Introduction:
  1. Bone mineral density serves as a crucial indicator of bone strength and is instrumental in diagnosing conditions such as osteoporosis.
  2. By gauging bone strength, clinicians can stratify patients based on their susceptibility to fractures.
  3. BMD detectionÂ  aids in determining appropriate treatment options, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up protocols tailored to an individual's bone health status.
  4. It helps identify bone health issues before they escalate, facilitating proactive measures to prevent conditions that could compromise mobility, independence, and overall quality of life.
